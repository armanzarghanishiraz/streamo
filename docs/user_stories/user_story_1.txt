The user wants to watch a new show they've heard about, but don't know what streaming services the show is on.
They know they can find this out through the app "Streamo," so they navigate to the site via their browser.
A prompt to search for their show allows them to type in the name and select it from the drop-down menu that live reacts to typed-in words.
Let's say the user dowesn't remember the name of their show very well: they will need to find the name as exactly as they can (perhaps via search browser or word-of-mouth) to narrow down their Streamo search.
After finding and clicking on the show, the user is presented with links to every streaming service that is currently hosting the show.
After searching for their preferred streaming service, the user clicks on the streaming service icon and is redirected to the streaming service in a separate window.
The user can then log in with their site credentials and watch their show.
